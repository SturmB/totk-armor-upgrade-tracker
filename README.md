## The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Armor Upgrade Tracker

**Note: The web site is still under construction and not launched yet. As soon as it is ready, the link will be posted here.**

This tracker is designed as a tool to help you keep track of the resources you need to obtain in order to upgrade various armors to specific levels.

### How to Use

Once the web app is live, instructions for use will be posted here.

[comment]: # (Simply make sure the armor you wish to track is checked, then adjust the slider below the name of the armor to specify which levels you are looking to upgrade it to. The resources and the quantity you will need for the upgrades are shown in the sidebar on the left. By default, all levels of all armors are tracked.)

### TODO

There are several things that I need to address after launching this app.

- [x] Add new armors and resources (as many as possible before launch).
- [ ] Make the sliders accept variable min & max tiers.
- [ ] Change color scheme for TotK.
- [ ] Update logo and branding for TotK.
- [x] Update existing armor requirements for TotK.
- [ ] Organize the armors by set (as much as I can).
- [ ] Organize the resources by type (as much as I can).
- [ ] Make image sizes consistent.
- [ ] Fix caching to address Redis value size limitation.
- [ ] Add a tri-state checkbox for each armor set to select/deselect all armors in that set.
- [ ] Replace the apparently abandoned [Livewire Range Slider](https://github.com/jantinnerezo/livewire-range-slider) with a pure-JavaScript usage of the [noUiSlider](https://refreshless.com/nouislider/).
